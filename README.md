Automation RetoServicios

Introduction ðŸš€
Automation made for a business challenge, with transactions to call APIs with GET, POST, PUT method.

Scenarios
Scenario: Consume API with GET method
   Since the user connects to the API
   When you consume the get method
   Then you should see response code 200
   Then verify that the id "8" exists

Scenario: Consume API with POST method
    Since the user connects to the API
    When you consume the post method with the name "Alejo"
    Then you should see response code 201
    Then verify that the name "Alejo" exists

Scenario: Consume API with PUT method
    Since the user connects to the API
    When you consume the put method with the name "DiegoA"
    Then you should see response code 200
    Then verify that the name has been changed to "DiegoA"

Automation Calculator

Introduction ðŸš€
Automation created in order to perform the basic operations in the calculator, addition, subtraction, multiplication and division

Scenarios
Scenario: Sum
    Since the user user opens the calculator
    When you perform the operation, add between "2" and "6"
    Then you should see the result "8"
Scenario: Subtraction
    When he performs the operation, he subtracts between "6" and "2"
    Then you should see the result "4" in the subtraction.
Scenario: Sum
    When you perform the multiplication operation between "2" and "6"
    Then you should see the result "12" in the multiplication.
Scenario: Division
    When you perform the division operation between "8" and "2"
    Then you should see the result "4" in the division.
